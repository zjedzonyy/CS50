Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
It's probability, there's no such thing as incorrect predictions. Simply, the more simulations we make the more real number we're gonna get.
So let's say we can't get correct results with the number of simulations lower than 1000.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
After 10 000
